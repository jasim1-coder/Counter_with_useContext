# useContext Hook Task

This is a React project where I demonstrate the usage of the `useContext` hook to manage state across components. The `useContext` hook allows you to share values across the component tree without prop drilling, making state management easier in complex applications.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which provides a fast development environment for React applications.
